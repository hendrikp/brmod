Custom keys:
* ´~´(tilde) open the br menu/stats screen/map you press 
* ´8´ put on armor it is the number 8
* ´7´ use a stimpack it is the number 7

There are three tiers of weapons:
* Green Tier - The lowest tier of weapons, has increased recoil and can have no attachments at all (except magazines since they are technically attachments)
* Blue Tier - The middle tier of weapons, has slight less recoil then blue but more then vanilla Miscreated weapons.  SMG/AR's can only attach all regular sights, no Optic or Hunting Scopes.  Bolt Actions take all scopes except Hunting Scopes.  
* Gold Tier - The best tier of weapons, vanilla Miscreated recoil, all attachments work for all guns just like in the base game.
