## Help
UI
* Minimap and Compass is automatically on the screen
* HUD for Stimpack and shield is at bottom
* ``~`` (tilde) open the BR menu/stats screen/map (``^`` - on some key-layouts e.g. german)

Additional keys:
* ``8`` put on the armor
* ``7`` use a stimpack

There are three tiers of weapons:
* Green Tier - The lowest tier of weapons, has increased recoil and can have no attachments at all (except magazines since they are technically attachments)
* Blue Tier - The middle tier of weapons has slightly less recoil then blue but more than vanilla Miscreated weapons.  SMG/AR's can only attach all regular sights, no Optic or Hunting Scopes.  Bolt Actions take all scopes except Hunting Scopes.  
* Gold Tier - The best-tier weapons, vanilla Miscreated recoil, all attachments work for all guns just like in the base game.
